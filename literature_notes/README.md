# Some literature notes

- [Origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus): Joint WHO-China report. Page 46 says that the December 1 case of a 62 year old man (presumably the one in the Lancet article?) didn'tactually have COVID-19 on December 1, but rather had something else and later got COVID-19, and so was retrospectively re-classified as not being an early case. Page 48-49 says they also decided that there weren't any missed cases from October 1 to December 10. From all this, they conclude first case didn't become ill until December 8.

Page 58 starts the molecular epidemiology section. Top of page 61 says an effort was made to aggregate all unpublished genomic data and identify additional samples for sequencing. Page 64 says the focus was on early sequences from December 2019 and January 2020, and they assembled all 768 sequences from prior to January-31-2020. Page 67 again describes searching for all SARS-CoV-2 or related genomic data up to 31 January 2020 (first two months it says). Notes how lineage A (also called S) shares 8782 and 28144 identities with RaTG13 and RmYN02, and the B (L) lineage (which contains Wuhan-Hu-1) does not have those shared identities. Table 6 lists strains from December 2019. Table 7 lists all sites of mutations relative to reference in early cases: 7866, 6968 + 11764, 24325, 24325, 4946 + 8782 + 28144, 12350 + 29019. They estimate (page 79) a TMRCA of Dec-11, with an interval of Nov 13 to Dec 23.

- [An evolutionary portrait of the progenitor SARS-CoV-2 and its dominant offshoots in COVID-19 pandemic](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msab118/6257226): Paper by Kumar, Pond, and Miura. Discusses issues with using sampling times to infer ancestor as such methods place earliest samples most ancestral. Argues that the progenitor of all SARS-CoV-2 differed from Wuhan-Hu-1 by three mutations: T18060C, T8782C, and C28144T. Notes that bat and pangolin sequences share the progenitor identities at these sites. Argues that several sequences (from Fujian, Guangdong, Hangzhou, and Washington) had the progenitor genome. Argues this means MRCA was well before December first recognized cases. They place MRCA in late October of 2019 to mid November. As the "outgroups", they use RaTG13, RmYN02, and pangolin MT121216.1.

- [Wang et al (2020)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026682v1.full-text) reported in a pre-print posted Feb-26-2020 that WeChat searches for terms related to SARS spiked as early as December 1, and had greatly increased by December 15.

- [SCMP (2020)](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back) reported government data shows the first case of the novel coronavirus traces back to November 17, and that there were nine cases reported in November (4 men and 5 women, all between age 39 and 79 and none confirmed to be "patient zero"), and that more than 180 people had been infected by December 27.

Then on Feb 27, 2020, he acalled back the Health Times to say that the November cases were entered incorrectly and other data have yet to be verified.
