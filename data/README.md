## GISAID sequences
Due to [GISAID data sharing terms](https://www.gisaid.org/help/faq/), the actual FASTA sequences are not tracked in this repo.
However, the subdirectories with GISAID sequences contain `*.tsv.xz` files that list the accessions, as well as acknowledging the originating and submitting labs.

- [comparator_genomes_gisaid](comparator_genomes_gisaid) contains bat virus comparator genomes as downloaded from GISAID on May-16-2021.
