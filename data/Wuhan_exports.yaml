    description: visited Wuhan from Dec-29-2019 to Jan-4-2020, first developed symptoms on Jan-4-2020 while still visiting Wuhan. Did not visit Huanan seafood market.
  # commmenting this one out as it's unclear if infected in Wuhan, or in Guangdong from a family contact infected in Wuhan.

    description: The strains hCoV-19/Guangdong/20SF012/2020, hCoV-19/Guangdong/20SF025/2020, and hCoV-19/Guangdong/20SF013/2020 appear to be cases 1, 2, and 3 from family cluster A of Kang et al (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141v3.full-text). This cluster involves patients who stayed in Wuhan from Dec-29-2020 to Jan-4-2020, and cases 1 and 3 had symptoms begin while still in Wuhan while case 2 had symptoms start on Jan 4 (the day she returned from Wuhan). Figure 4 of Kang et al (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20019141v3.full-text) shows mutations but with 265 nt offset, so after correcting for that offset it's clear in cluster A all patients have (relative to Wuhan-Hu-1) C8782T, T28144C, and C29095T. In addition, Table S1 of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420304864 says that hCoV-19/Guangdong/20SF012/2020, hCoV-19/Guangdong/20SF025/2020, and hCoV-19/Guangdong/20SF013/2020 are from Kang et al. All three of these sequences have the three mutations indicated in Kang et al and are the only sequences from Kang et al that do, so this indicates that these three sequences are cases 1 to 3 from clsuter A.
